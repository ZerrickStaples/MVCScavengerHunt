Twitter is a website that uses MVC in its framework. The user is able to input their thoughts into a box and send them out. The M in MVC stands for model, which is the database of the web application. Twitter's database stores every tweet that is sent out, by millions of users. Included in the tweets are photos, videos, and links to other websites. The tweets are listed in chronological order, most of the time, and lists them in a ‘timeline’.
        From the database and model, this is sent to the view. Which is what the user sees. They are able to click on the tweets, and view certain information. Info such as the user who sent the tweet, the time and date, and the tweet itself. There is also the ability to 'retweet' the tweet, which sends the tweet for other users to view. 
        The control is the user input, which is what the user is allowed to share to the people who follow them on the site. The user is limited to 140 characters per tweet, though, not including pictures or links to other websites in the 140 character limit.
